## About The Project

[![Game ScreenShot][game-screenshot]](https://github.com/filliperomero/TheMagician)

This project was developed in a Course where we created a Top Down Multiplayer RPG style game implemeting a variety of offensive and defensive abilities that can be upgraded through a Skill Tree System where we can receive points when leveling up by killing enemies. We also receive attribute points when leveling up to be spent on attributes and those attributes affect directly our damage, defense, critical chance and etc. We have a in depth attribute system with many attributes to upgrade.

We have a few types of enemies like melee, ranger and summoners which will summon a number of minions to fight against you.

We also implemented a pickup system like Diablo where on enemy death, there is a chance where a Mana or Health potion can be dropped and picked up by the player where the potion will be used immediately.

We implemented a robust Damage and Debuff system able to handle a lot of complicated calculations and mechanics.

We have a Saving System implemented where when we walk through a "Beam", it will act like a checkpoint and save our progress automatically. We can create multiples saves with this system as well.

This game was developed following SOLID coding principles and balance Blueprint/C++ ratio. Also, it has a robust UI system for the Attributes/Skills where it is ready to scale if necessary.
